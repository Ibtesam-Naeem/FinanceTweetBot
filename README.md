# FinancialSuite TwitterBot
### Automated Earnings, Economic Events, and Market Update Tweets

This project automates the process of tweeting about **earnings reports**, **economic events**, and **market updates** using **Tweepy** and the **Twitter/X API**. It fetches real-time and historical data from **FinancialSuite-Backend**, **Polygon API**, and **SEC API**, formats it into clean, informative tweets, and posts them automatically.

The bot runs on a scheduled system and continuously monitors **real-time earnings reports** via the SEC API to deliver timely tweets as soon as earnings are released.
